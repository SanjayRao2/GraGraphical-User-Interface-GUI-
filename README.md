# Graphical-User-Interface-GUI-

This project focuses on connecting Python to a database via the Python Connector
interface. There are two main parts: The Graphical User Interface (GUI)
and the Data Access Object (DAO). In addition, there are some interface classes to glue the
two main pieces together.

The python code is written in such as way as to separate the GUI from the database access.

This makes it easier to change out the GUI (i.e. to a Web-based interface) or databases (i.e. to Oracle) at a later.  

The database tables used are the Henry Bookstore tables.

The python GUI is a front-end search to a bookstore database. It provides searching by Author, Category, and
Publisher.
